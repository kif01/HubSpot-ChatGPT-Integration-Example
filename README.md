# HubSpot-ChatGPT-Integration-Example

This is an example of a sentiment analysis and topic extraction use case in HubSpot. Imagine a situation where we want to capture the sentiment and the main topic of a submitted Ticket. This would be useful in reporting to get insights on the trending topics that customers ask about, and to understand their reactions. It can be used as well for better routing: If the topic of the query was about billing then the ticket will be routed to the billing team, if it was about something about the product then it goes to product team etc..
